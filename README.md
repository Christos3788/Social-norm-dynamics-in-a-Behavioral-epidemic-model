# Social-norm-dynamics-in-a-Behavioral-epidemic-model
We develop a behavioral epidemic model coupling vaccination dynamics with evolving social norms on multilayer networks. Decisions combine Experience-Weighted Attraction learning with descriptive and injunctive norms. Simulations show injunctive norms sustain vaccination at low prevalence, while descriptive norms are weaker or unstable.
